# Dimension Reduction with Insertion and Deletion
First, we should install required python libraries.
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Real Dataset
All real valued experiments are in `Dimensionality-Reduction - Real` folder.

To run the experiments, change directory to `Dimensionality-Reduction - Real/Test Files`. Each of three python files represents an experiments suggested by the file name.
To run the experiment:

```sh
$ python3 <python_file_name> <number_of_data_pairs>
```

## Binary Dataset

All real valued experiments are in `Dimensionality-Reduction - Binary` folder.

To run the experiments, change directory to `Dimensionality-Reduction - Binary/Test Files`. Each of three python files represents an experiments suggested by the file name. `js`, `cs` suggest `jaccard similarity` and `cosine similarity` respectively.
To run the experiment:

```sh
$ python3 <python_file_name> <number_of_data_pairs>
```
